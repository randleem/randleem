### Greetings, I'm Emma, welcome to my GitHub Page

Unfortunately, I've been having git problems (what a git) and realised my email address and user name were not set up correctly and didnt match my github, therefore, my git history isn't showing properly. 

However, I have cloned many of our School of Code project repos which contain examples of code I have contributed on.
