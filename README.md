### Greetings, I'm Emma, welcome to my GitHub Page

I am a full-stack developer who has recently completed a 16-week coding bootcamp hosted by the [school of code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk). 

My background is in palaeontological research, where I was first introduced to coding, performing data analysis and visualisation in R and RStudio. 

I now want a new challenge in life and I am very excited to delve into a new and exciting career in tech. 

I love creative problem solving and collaboratively working in agile tech teams. 

Unfortunately, I've been having git problems (what a git) and realised my email address and username were not set up correctly, and didn't match my github. 

My git history, is therefore incomplete and doesnt fully show my activity. 

However, I have cloned many of our School of Code project repos which contain examples of code I have worked and contributed to. 

If you have any questions or would like a chat, please don't hesitate to get in touch ðŸ˜€
