### Greetings, I'm Emma, welcome to my GitHub Page

Unfortunately, I've been having git problems (what a git) and realised my email address and username were not set up correctly, and didn't match my github. 

My git history, therefore isn't showing properly. 

However, I have cloned many of our School of Code project repos which contain examples of code I have worked and contributed to.
